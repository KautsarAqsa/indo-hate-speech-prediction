# Indonesian Language Hate-Speech Prediction
This repository contains a supervised machine learning model for predicting hate speech in Indonesian language. Models that have been trained and evaluated 
are logistic regression, lightGBM, and neural-network models. 
The dataset used is Indonesian tweet from: 
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okkyibrohim/id-multi-label-hate-speech-and-abusive-language-detection/master/re_dataset.csv`

There are 4 notebooks in this repo. Ideal order for reading:
`Hatespeech_Cleaning.ipynb` -> `Hatespeech_Logistic_Regression.ipynb` -> `Hatespeech_LightGBM.ipynb` -> `Hatespeech_NN.ipynb`

## Prerequisites
You will need to have the following software installed (already installed on Google Colab):

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- LightGBM
